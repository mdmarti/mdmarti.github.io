# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement. Learning. Both words we've heard before. But together,
what do these words mean? These are great questions. Let's talk about
them together. Today, we're going to be discussing:

- What is reinforcement learning?
- How can we make a simple RL modts in Python?
- How does RL apply to neuro?

This tutorial is adapted from [Raphael's prior tutorial with
R](https://dibsmethodsmeetings.github.io/RL-Guide/), and draws on [this
great book that you should absolutely read if you're interested in
RL](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)!

# What is RL?

At its core, RL is about how we learn from rewards (and lack of
rewards/punishment). We interact with our environment; certain things in
our environment give us rewards, and performing certain actions lets us
get those rewards. RL is a framework for how we learn about those
rewards in our environment and adapt our actions to let us get more
rewards. This is all very vague, but some specific examples are:

1.  Classical conditioning A guy named Pavlov trained his dogs to
    associate the sound of a bell with food (since he would ring a bell,
    then feed his dogs). They started salivating in response to the
    bell! This is an example of **learning about rewards in our
    environment**; the dogs were learning that the bell was a signifier
    of reward.

2.  Bandit problems A bandit problem is where someone is presented with
    a lever, and they're given the chance to pull the lever or not pull
    the lever. You have some probability of getting a reward when you
    pull the lever, and in some setups pulling the lever has some cost.
    People have to learn whether pulling the lever will be rewarding (on
    average), and need to choose whether or not to pull the lever. This
    comes from gambling (a slot machine is a one-armed bandit). People
    have extended this problem to multi-arm bandits. Instead of just one
    lever, there are 'k' arms that all give different rewards. People
    have to learn the rewards, then choose which levers to pull to
    maximize their rewards.

Fun fact about bandit problems: lots of psychology problems are framed
in this way. We present subjects with stimuli that they have to learn to
associate with rewards, they learn to maximize rewards, we change the
reward distribution, and play that whole game all over again.

We're going to be coding up and simulating a bandit problem today! A
2-arm bandit. Fun fact is that this type of model can be used to make
predictions about how people will learn and make choices in
decision-making problems. With that being said, let's dive right in.


<a id='simpleRL'></a>

# How do we make a simple RL model in Python?

Reinforcement learning in general is hard. Luckily, we've simplified our
job by giving our environment only two 'states', or things that can
happen: lever 1 can be pulled or lever 2 can be pulled. We can
explicitly calculate the 'value' of being in each of these two states.
To simplify this value calculation, let's say that they each give the
same reward (1 unit of reward), and lever 1 has a 70% chance of giving a
reward while Arm 2 has a 30% chance of giving a reward. Our model's job
is to learn these values. We'll be using numpy and base python to fit
our model, and matplotlib to visualize the results!



``` python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import copy
from tqdm import tqdm
```


``` python
nArms = 2
armProbs = [0.7,0.3]
armRewards = [1,1]
```

<a id='qvals'></a>

## Q-Values

In RL-speak, the **Q-Value** is our model's representation of the value
of each state. We can essentially just make a little table with one
entry for each state, and pop the estimated value of that state into the
table. This doesn't work anymore as the number of things that can happen
get really big (like in the real world), but will be perfect for us
because only two things will happen! We will initialize our Q-values to
0.5, indicating that before doing anything, we think both levers are
equally valuable.

<a id='policies'></a>

## Policies

Now that we have a representation of the world, we need to interact with
the world. The way our model chooses to interact with the world is
called the model's **policy**. In state-of-the-art machine learning, our
models learn their policies too, but here we have to pick a policy.
Policies are typically thought of as *greedy* or not. A greedy policy
leans towards picking an action corresponding to the highest Q value,
while a less greedy policy will more often sample across all actions.

**What would the issue be with always picking the action with the
highest Q value?**

We're going to compare between two policies: an $$\epsilon$$-greedy policy
and a softmax policy. An $$\epsilon$$-greedy policy selects the best
action with probability $$1 - \epsilon$$, and uniformly selects an action
with probability $$\epsilon$$. A softmax policy uses the softmax function
to turn Q values into probabilities, then samples an action based on
those probabilities. It requires a parameter called $$\beta$$, and a
larger $$\beta$$ corresponds to a greedier policy. Let's code these both
up here, with $$\epsilon = 0.1$$, $$\beta = 4$$. Since the Q values are
equal at the beginning, we'll randomly pick the first epsilon-greedy
model action too.


``` python
epsilon = 0.1
beta = 4
actions = [0,1]
epsilonQs = np.array([0.5,0.5])
softmaxQs = np.array([0.5,0.5])
softmaxProbs = np.exp(beta * softmaxQs)/np.sum(np.exp(beta * softmaxQs))
epsilonAction = np.random.choice(actions,1,p=epsilonQs)[0]
softmaxAction = np.random.choice(actions,1,p=softmaxProbs)[0]

print(f"Epsilon model picked lever {epsilonAction + 1}")
print(f"Softmax model picked lever {softmaxAction + 1}")
```

```
    Epsilon model picked lever 2
    Softmax model picked lever 1
```

<a id='updates'></a>

## Sampling rewards and updating Q values

Now that our models have each chosen an action, let's get them their
rewards! Our rewards are probabilistic, so we need do some more
sampling. To actually UPDATE our Q-values, we need to learn from our
mistakes. Our error is just going to be the actual reward that we got (1
or 0 here) minus our predicted value of the state (the current Q-value).
To stabilize learning in our model, we're going to downweight that
prediction error a little bit (by a learning rate $$\alpha$$): this is a
typical trick in machine learning to make sure no single error changes
the model too much. We'll set ours to 0.1 here.

``` python
alpha=0.1
epsilonReward =  armRewards[epsilonAction]*np.random.binomial(1,armProbs[epsilonAction])
softmaxReward = armRewards[softmaxAction]*np.random.binomial(1,armProbs[softmaxAction])

print(f"Epsilon model got a reward of: {epsilonReward}")
print(f"Softmax model got a reward of: {softmaxReward}")

epsilonError = epsilonReward - epsilonQs[epsilonAction]
softmaxError = softmaxReward - softmaxQs[softmaxAction]

print(f"Our epsilon model's error: {epsilonError}")
print(f"Our softmax model's error: {softmaxError}")

epsilonQs[epsilonAction] = epsilonQs[epsilonAction] + alpha*epsilonError
softmaxQs[softmaxAction] = softmaxQs[softmaxAction] + alpha*softmaxError

print(f"New epsilon model Qs: {epsilonQs}")
print(f"New softmax models Qs: {softmaxQs}")
```

```
    Epsilon model got a reward of: 1
    Softmax model got a reward of: 0
    Our epsilon model's error: 0.5
    Our softmax model's error: -0.5
    New epsilon model Qs: [0.5  0.55]
    New softmax models Qs: [0.45 0.5 ]

```

## Rinse and repeat

We then continue this process of sampling and updating our Q values
until everything stabilizes! Since our environmnent isn't changing, our
estimates WILL stabilize. Let's make each of these into a class so that
we can train our models more easily, then train them for a few
iterations!

``` python
from abc import ABC,abstractmethod
class BanditModel(ABC):

    def __init__(self,alpha,n_actions=2):

        self.alpha = alpha

    def pickAction(self):

        return NotImplemented

    def calculateError(self,action,reward):

        error = reward - self.Qs[action]
        return error

    def updateQs(self,action,reward):

        error = self.calculateError(action,reward)

        self.Qs[action] += self.alpha*error

class epsilonGreedyModel(BanditModel):

        sample = np.random.uniform(0,1)
        if sample < self.epsilon:

        else:

        return action

    def pickAction(self):

        softmaxProbs = np.exp(self.beta * self.Qs)/np.sum(np.exp(self.beta * self.Qs))

        action = np.random.choice(len(self.Qs),1,p=softmaxProbs)[0]

        return action

class bandit():

    def __init__(self,rewardProbs,rewards):

        self.rewardProbs = rewardProbs
        self.rewards = rewards

    def sampleReward(self,action):

        return self.rewards[action]*np.random.binomial(1,self.rewardProbs[action])
```


``` python

```


``` python

for ii in range(5):

    model1Action = model1.pickAction()
    model2Action = model2.pickAction()

    model1Reward = bandit1.sampleReward(model1Action)
    model2Reward = bandit1.sampleReward(model2Action)

    print(f"Epsilon Greedy Qs before updating: {model1.Qs}")
    model1.updateQs(model1Action,model1Reward)
    print(f"Epsilon Greedy Qs after updating: {model1.Qs}")

    print(f"Softmax Qs before updating: {model2.Qs}")
    model2.updateQs(model2Action,model2Reward)

As you can see, our Q values are updating each trial! Let's run a whole
process to see how Q values look across time.

Great! So it seems like both of these models get close to the right Q
value for each of the arms! But how do they perform in terms of the
rewards that they get? To find this out, let's average the reward
collected over a bunch of different model fits.


``` python
%matplotlib inline

nUpdates = 1000


nFits = 1000

rewards1 = []
rewards2 = []

for jj in tqdm(range(nFits), desc="Fitting different models"):
    model1 = epsilonGreedyModel(epsilon=0.1,alpha=0.1,n_actions=2)
    model2 = softmaxModel(beta=5,alpha=0.1,n_actions=2)
    bandit1 = bandit(rewardProbs=[0.7,0.3],rewards=[1,1])

    tmpRewards1 = []
    tmpRewards2 = []
    
    for ii in range(nUpdates):
    
        model1Action = model1.pickAction()
        model2Action = model2.pickAction()
    
        model1Reward = bandit1.sampleReward(model1Action)
        model2Reward = bandit1.sampleReward(model2Action)
    
        model1.updateQs(model1Action,model1Reward)
        model2.updateQs(model2Action,model2Reward)
        tmpRewards1.append(model1Reward)
        tmpRewards2.append(model2Reward)

    rewards1.append(np.array(tmpRewards1))
    rewards2.append(np.array(tmpRewards2))
        



fig,ax= plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=1,figsize=(10,5))
x = np.arange(1,nUpdates + 1)
meanRewards1 = np.nanmean(np.array(rewards1),axis=0)
meanRewards2 = np.nanmean(np.array(rewards2),axis=0)
ax.plot(x,meanRewards1,label="Epsilon-Greedy Model")
ax.plot(x,meanRewards2,label="Softmax Model")
ax.set_ylabel("Mean Reward")
ax.set_xlabel("Update Number")
plt.legend(loc='right')

There you have it! We now have bandit models and good ways to compare
them. Let's do some of this ourselves!

<a id='coding'></a>

1.  How do these models perform when we change $$\epsilon$$? What about
    $$\beta$$?
2.  What happens if we add in more arms? What if we change how rewarding
    each arm is?
3.  What happens if we turn the reward for each arm into a distribution
    of rewards instead of a deterministic value?

<a id='rlneuropsych'></a>

# How does any of this relate to neuro & psych?

Well, people go to casinos all the time, so there's that. In a much more
real sense, we're faced with choices with unknown outcomes all the time,
and we have to 1. make decisions based on our expectations of the
outcomes, then 2. learn from the outcomes of our decisions. One of the
early (but also foundational) models of this is the [Rescorla-Wagner
model](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescorla–Wagner_model#>),
which posits that animals only learn when events violate their
expectations (or when their predictions are off). Their model was meant
to account for blocking: the phenomenon where if an animal learns a
relationship between a stimulus and a reward, that learned relationship
*blocks* it from learning a relationship between any new stimuli
presented alongside the stimuli with the learned relationships. The
learning here is very similar to that in the bandit problem; the model
updates its internal state values through a scaled prediction error.

This kind of psychological process is mirrored in the activity of
dopamine (DA) neurons as well! The classic Wolfram Shultz experiments
detailed how DA neurons phasically adjust their firing rates based not
just on reward, but on the difference between the received reward and
expected reward. Much of the work in psych and neuro on learning has
been built off of this concept. The errors in this model are
specifically **Temporal-Difference (TD) Errors**: prediction errors in
the model are assigned to stimuli nearby in time. There are more details
there, but we don't have enough time to cover them here.
