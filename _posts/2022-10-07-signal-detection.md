# Signal detection in math and psychology

When we are thinking about signal detection, we typically are concerened
with separating between some signal and noise. In an experiment, on each
trial, we have a signal that may or may not be present. At each point,
noise is added to create the stimulus. Then this goes through a detector
– sometimes a machine learning algorithm, sometimes a human being – to
decide if the signal is present or not.

In recognition tasks, we often expose people to novel and seen before
stimuli. The novel stimuli are the noise and those they have seen before
are the signal. They themselves are the detector, and are the ones to
decide if signal is present or not. We want to be able to say something
about their sensitivity to stimuli and their bias in these tasks, and
for that we turn to signal detection theory! In psychology, this type of
terminology originated in perception tasks, where many of these terms
make a lot of sense too - in recognition/memory tasks, the signal and
noise are more internal, whereas in perception tasks the signal and
noise are mainly external.

We're generally interested in a couple things: first, a participant's sensitivity to
the signal (indicated by how often they correctly say that a signal is present).
This is also a measure of how 'strong' their signal distribution is, or how 
distinct it is from their noise distribution. In other words, how easy is it for 
participants to tell that they've seen a stimulus before?

We're also interested in a participant's bias, or propensity to say yes. This is 
also known as the criterion (which will be marked as c). We can estimate both of these 
properties by asking participants simple yes/no questions ("have you seen this stimulus 
before?"), and then using R to analyze the data!


## CREDIT CREDIT CREDIT

the examples and code from this tutorial come from [this
tutorial](https://sometimesir.com/posts/2017-10-09-bayesian-estimation-of-signal-detection-theory-models/),
which Kevin sent me, and the thoughts and words come from my brain and
class notes. THE CODE IS NOT MINE! i am dusting off R for the first time
in a literal year

## Terms and notation

When thinking about Detecting Signals, there are four possible outcomes
of our Signal Detection: 1. There could be a signal, and we could detect
it (a **hit**) 2. There could be a signal, and we could not detect it (a
**miss**) 3. There could be no signal, and we could say there is no
signal (a **correct rejection**,or **CR**) 4. There could be no signal,
and we could think there’s a signal (a **false positive**, or **FP**)

There are therefore a few values we’re interested in: The probability
our participants were correct:

$$
\mathbb{P}_{\text{correct}} = \mathbb{P}(\textbf{hit}) + \mathbb{P}(\textbf{CR})
$$

The probability that our participants were wrong:

$$
\mathbb{P}_{\text{error}} = \mathbb{P}(\textbf{miss}) + \mathbb{P}(\textbf{FP})
$$

The hit rate:

$$
HR = \frac{\text{Number of  Hits}}{\text{Number of Signals}}
$$

The FP rate:

$$
FPR = \frac{\text{Number of FPs}}{\text{Number of Noise Trials}}
$$

The hit rate and false positive rate are particularly important, because
they tell us about where our signal distribution is and where our
detection criterion is. The way people typically think about this is in
terms of two overlapping Gaussian distributions, like here:

![Overlapping Gaussians
Example](/assets/img/2022-10-07-signal-detection/signal_detection.png)

The <span style="color: red;">red</span> Gaussian is our noise
distribution - thought to be centered at zero intensity (has a mean of
zero).

The <span style="color:blue;">blue</span> Gaussian is our signal
distribution. It has some positive mean, indicated by <span
style="color: lime;">d’</span>. The shaded region of the <span
style="color:blue;"> blue </span> Gaussian indicates the area of the
signal distribution above our decision criterion, c. This area is
equivalent to the probability that we say that there is a signal given
that we see a signal, a.k.a. our HR. The shaded region of the <span
style="color:red;">red</span> Gaussian is the area of the noise
distribution above our criterion, equivalent to our FPR.

## Equal Variance Gaussian Model

Given this framework, we actually already have everything we need to
start to estimate each participant’s sensitivity and bias. In the
**Equal Variance Gaussian** model, our noise and signal distributions
are assumed to be Gaussians with unit variance and different means. 
This is the model we'll cover today! If you're interested in more complex
things we can do that in the future.
Under this framework, the noise distribution is a standard normal, and
the <span style="color: lime;">d’</span> we estimate is the distance,
measured in standard deviations, of the mean of our signal distribution from the
mean of the noise distribution.

If we shift the signal distribution over by <span
style="color: lime;">d’</span>, we can overlay the signal and noise
distributions, since their variances are assumed equal.

![Overlaid
Gaussians](/assets/img/2022-10-07-signal-detection/overlaid_signal_noise.png)

We can then use some helpful properties of the Gaussian distribution to
help us figure out what <span style="color: lime;">d’</span> and c are.
We have our <span style="color: blue;">HR</span> and <span
style="color: red;">FPR</span> indicated above, and since these come
from standard normal distributions, we can use the cumulative density
function (CDF) indicated by \\( \Phi\\), to describe our HR and FPR. The CDF
of a distribution, \\(\Phi(x)\\), is the area under our distribution less
than or equal to x, or the probability that we see a value drawn from
our distribution less than or equal to x. Since Gaussians are symmetric
around their mean, we ALSO know that \\(P(x < z) = P(x > -z)\\) (see figure below) 

![phi(x)](/assets/img/2022-10-07-signal-detection/phi_x.png)


We can use this
sneaky trick to say the following:

$$
HR = \Phi(d' - c)
$$

Our HR is the probability our signal distribution lays to the right of
our criterion. Since we shifted our signal distribution to the right by
subtracting d’, this is the same as the probability a standard normal is
greater than c - d’. Reversing this, this is finally equivalent to the
probability a standard normal is LESS than d’ - c.

$$
FPR = \Phi(-c)
$$

Since we did not shift our noise distribution at all, and again that
distribution is symmetric. The inverse of this function, \\(\Phi^{-1}(x)\\),
exists also and I’m not gonna draw it out or say anything more than that
it exists so please just believe me. Given this, we know that

$$
\Phi^{-1}(HR) = d' - c, \; \Phi^{-1}(FPR) = -c
$$

So we have our criterion from our FPR! If we subtract the right half
from the left half, our c’s cancel and we get back d’, giving

$$
d' = \Phi^{-1}(HR) -  \Phi^{-1}(FPR)
$$

Thanks for sitting through me through this math! Now we can do this in
R. The link linked in the first section has this code so if you want another explanation go there!Libraries used:

    library(knitr)
    library(scales)
    library(bayesplot)
    library(ggridges)
    library(sdtalt)
    library(brms)
    library(tidyverse)

Data used, from the sdtalt package and Wright 2011 [^0]:

| subno | sayold | isold |
|------:|-------:|------:|
|    53 |      1 |     0 |
|    53 |      1 |     1 |
|    53 |      1 |     1 |
|    53 |      1 |     1 |
|    53 |      1 |     0 |


We first need to find what kind of trial each trial was (Hit, FP, CR, or
miss). We can do this doing the following:

``` r
sdt <- confcontr %>%
    mutate(
        type="hit",
        type = ifelse(isold == 1 & sayold == 0, "miss",type),
        type = ifelse(isold == 0 & sayold==0, "cr",type),
        type=ifelse(isold == 0 & sayold == 1, "fp", type)
    )
```

These lines of code create a new “type” variable that codes for what
trial type our participants ended up giving us. We can then format this
for each participant to give us one row per participant, so we can find
hit rates, FPRs, etc.

``` r
sdt <- sdt %>%
    group_by(subno,type) %>%
    summarise(count=n()) %>%
    spread(type,count) #formats to one row per participant
```


R has a nice function to let us calculate $\Phi^{-1}(x)$, `qnorm()`.
Using this to calculate d’, c:

``` r
sdt <- sdt %>%
    mutate(
        zhr = qnorm(hit/(hit + miss)),
        zfp = qnorm(fp/(fp + cr)),
        dprime = zhr - zfp,
        crit = -zfp
    )

kable(sdt[1:5, ], caption = "Point estimates of d', c")
```

| subno |  cr |  fp | hit | miss |       zhr |        zfp |    dprime |      crit |

Point estimates of d’, c

Yay! This is great this gives estimates for our quantities of interest,
d’ and c. But there are other ways we can look at this!

## Estimating Equal Variance Gaussian model with GLM

You’ve seen our point estimates (above), which give us the most likely
parameter estimates for our model - there, we are using a frequentist
perspective to estimate our parameters. We can approach this from a more
Bayesian perspective, however.

We can model probabilities using logistic regression models, in these
models, we model our outcomes as binary (1 if participants say they’d
seen a stimulus before, 0 otherwise). These assume that each trial is
independently drawn from a Bernoulli distribution, with the probability
of a trial being a 1 set to \\(p\\). We can model \\(p\\) as \\(\Phi(\eta)\\) -
again, the probability that a standard normal distribution is less than
\\(\eta\\). We then get to choose how we model \\(\eta\\), based on our data.
Our life is made simpler if we choose a linear relationship between our
data and \\(\eta\\): \\(\eta = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * \text{stimulus seen}\\). This
parameterization gives us a good interpretation for these parameters.
Let’s say the simulus is new, which means that stimulus_seen = 0. Our
interpretation for \\(p\\) here is our FPR: the probability of saying we’ve
seen a stimulus, when we in fact have not. Then \\(\eta\\) = \\(\beta_0\\), and
\\(FPR = \Phi(\beta_0)\\). This looks familiar to what we had above, which
what \\(FPR = \Phi(-c)\\). When stimulus_seen = 1, our \\(p\\) is the
probability of getting a hit, or our HR. From above, we have
\\(HR = \Phi(d' - c)\\). This trial type gives \\(\eta = -c + \beta_1\\), so
\\(d' = \beta_1\\)! How nice. We can fit this on an individual subjects
level doing the following:

``` r
evsdt_1 <- brm(
  sayold ~ isold,
  family = bernoulli(link="probit"),
  data = filter(confcontr,subno == 53),
  cores = 4,
  file="sdtmodel1-1"
)
```

This framework uses the BAYESIAN REGRESSION MODELING package brms! This is
wonderful since brms extends to complicated frameworks in the future. It
saves the model in evsdt_1, and we can get a summary of what’s going on
here with this:

``` r
summary(evsdt_1)
```

    ##  Family: bernoulli 
    ##   Links: mu = probit 
    ## Formula: sayold ~ isold 
    ##    Data: filter(confcontr, subno == 53) (Number of observations: 100) 
    ##   Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;
    ##          total post-warmup draws = 4000
    ## 
    ## Population-Level Effects: 
    ##           Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS
    ## Intercept    -0.32      0.17    -0.66     0.02 1.00     3250     2605
    ## isold         0.39      0.25    -0.10     0.90 1.00     3532     2566
    ## 
    ## Draws were sampled using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS
    ## and Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential
    ## scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).

we can then visualize this using the following:

``` r
posterior <- as.array(evsdt_1)


scatter_dprime_c <- mcmc_scatter(
  posterior,
  pars=c("b_Intercept","b_isold"),
  size=1
)
scatter_dprime_c
```

![](/assets/img/2022-10-07-signal-detection/estimates_glm.png)<!-- -->

There are PROBABLY better ways to look at these, but this is what I have chosen! Here, b_isold is \\(\beta_1\\), or d', while b_Intercept is -c.

## Nonlinear Equal Variance Gaussian Model

We can additionally make this model nonlinear to directly estimate c and
d’. Specifically, instead of estimating \\(\eta\\), we can write:

$$
p = \Phi(d'*\text{seen before} - c) 
$$

This looks the same as before, but is directly estimating these two
parameters. This makes things a bit more complicated, so we can use a
nonlinear model! Specifying this model can be done with similar syntax
to before:

``` r
nonlinear_model <- bf(
    sayold ~ Phi(dprime * isold - c),
    dprime ~ 1, c ~ 1,
    nl=TRUE
)
```

This code is first, detailing the relationship between the probability
our participants said a stimulus was old (sayold \~ Phi(dprime \*
isold - c)).

The second line tells the model to estimate both dprime and c (dprime \~
1, c \~ 1). The third line says that the model is nonlinear. This is a
more difficult problem to solve (in general), so the package used by
this one guy requires us to set priors on dprime and c, using the
following lines of code:

``` r
Priors <- c(
  prior(normal(.5, 3), nlpar = "dprime"),
  prior(normal(0, 1.5), nlpar = "c")
)
```

Finally, we can estimate our model! We can do this for each participant.
It’s again using brm, as follows:

``` r
evsdt_2 <- brm(
  nonlinear_model,
  family = bernoulli(link = "identity"),
  data = filter(confcontr, subno == 53),
  prior = Priors,
  control = list(adapt_delta = .99),
  cores = 4,
  file = "sdtmodel1-2"
)
```

Here, the link function is the identity because our model is already
nonlinear- we don’t need to introduce a link function.

Then we can compare the first model and the second model!

    evsdt_1:

    ##  Family: bernoulli 
    ##   Links: mu = probit 
    ## Formula: sayold ~ isold 
    ##    Data: filter(confcontr, subno == 53) (Number of observations: 100) 
    ##   Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;

    ## and Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential

    evsdt_2:

    ##   Links: mu = identity 
    ## Formula: sayold ~ Phi(dprime * isold - c) 
    ##          dprime ~ 1
    ##          c ~ 1
    ##    Data: filter(confcontr, subno == 53) (Number of observations: 100) 
    ##   Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;
    ##          total post-warmup draws = 4000
    ## 
    ## Population-Level Effects: 
    ##                  Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS
    ## dprime_Intercept     0.40      0.25    -0.10     0.88 1.00     1231     1418
    ## c_Intercept          0.31      0.18    -0.04     0.66 1.00     1099     1306
    ## 
    ## Draws were sampled using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS
    ## and Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential
    ## scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).

These give roughly the same results, but it can be useful in other
situations to use a more complex model to fit data - and this is a way
to do that.

## Multiple participants estimation

To model multiple participants, you can either summarize the point
estimates OR estimate a hierarchical model.

### Summarizing point estimates

Since we calculated d’ and c for all of our participants, we can
summarize those to give us a mean and standard deviation for each
parameter:

``` r
sdt_sum <- select(sdt,subno,dprime,crit) %>%
  gather(parameter,value,-subno) %>%
  group_by(parameter) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),mu=mean(value),sd=sd(value),se=sd/sqrt(n))
```

| parameter |   n |        mu |        sd |        se |
|:----------|----:|----------:|----------:|----------:|
| crit      |  31 | 0.6747305 | 0.3310206 | 0.0594531 |
| dprime    |  31 | 1.0858403 | 0.5011256 | 0.0900048 |

This gives us average values, standard deviations, and standard errors
for our parameter estimates across our population. Then we can run
t-tests and the sort on this stuff!

### Hierarchical modeling

We could ALSO use a hierarchical model, in which we modify the logistic
regression from above: we fit a logistic model for each participant,
with the participant-specific parameters drawn from a multivariate
normal distribution:

$$
\eta_j = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j}*\text{seen before} \\
\begin{bmatrix}
\beta_{0j} \\
\beta_{1j} 
\end{bmatrix} \sim MVN(
\bigg [\begin{array}{c}
\mu_0 \\
\mu_1 \\
\end{array}\bigg ], \Sigma)
$$

This gives us a model where we have an estimate for each participant,
but also an estimate of each parameter “for the average participant”. It
also tells us about the variance of each parameter and the covariance
between parameters, which in turn give us standard deviations and
correlations. Standard deviations for each parameter tell us about
typical variance in the population, and correlations tell us about the
typical relationship between d’ and c. In order to fully specify this
model, we need to estimate 5 parameters on the population level:
\\(\mu_1\\), \\(\mu_2\\), \\(\mathbb{V}[\beta_0]\\), \\(\mathbb{V}[\beta_1]\\), and
covar\\((\beta_0,\beta_1)\\).

We can again use brms to build these models. The formula looks a bit
different, but the overall model is the same:

``` r
evsdt_glmm <- brm(sayold ~ 1 + isold + (1 + isold | subno),
  family = bernoulli(link = "probit"),
  data = confcontr,
  cores = 4,
  file = "sdtmodel2-1"
)
```

The part of the formula outside of the parentheses specifies that we
want to estimate the mean intercept and mean slope for all participants,
and the part within the parentheses says that we want to estimative the
variance and covariance of those parameters across participants.

Again, the intercept is our -c, and the slope is d’. We can then compare
these estimates to our manual estimates across our population!

| parameter |   n |        mu |        sd |        se |
|:----------|----:|----------:|----------:|----------:|
| crit      |  31 | 0.6747305 | 0.3310206 | 0.0594531 |
| dprime    |  31 | 1.0858403 | 0.5011256 | 0.0900048 |

By looking at this, we can see that *on average* our estimates are the
same between these two methods, but the manual calculation method
estimates a higher standard deviation for these parameters among our
participants! That’s pretty neat.

Anyway, overall these are a few different methods of estimating
sensitivity and bias in recognition tasks, whether they be memory-based
or psychophysics based! If you have any more questions! please ask me.

frame this ENTIRELY differently, draw some graphs yourself. you are
selling this to a cogneuro crowd, so you don’t actually NEED very much
SDT. you just need to justify what d’, c are, then tell use why
different versions of this matter.
