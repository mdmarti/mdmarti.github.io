# Plotting in Python: A quick rundown

Plotting. We all gotta do it. but how do we do it? Today that's exactly
what we're going to talk about. We're going to start very basic: what
are the elements of the plots themselves that we can interact with, how
do we draw on things, how do we choose what to draw on. Then we will
talk about **what** to draw: lines, scatters, and histograms. Finally,
throughout the whole tutorial: how do we change aspects of plots to make
them look better?

## What do we plot on?

Let's start by importing the packages we'll need:

``` python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

The first two packages are data packages: numpy represents data as
matrices, pandas as tables (like an excel/google worksheet). We'll get
into those later. The last two are plotting: matplotlib is the basis for
almost all plots people make in Python, seaborn builds off of matplotlib
to make plotting pretty plots easier. Starting with matplotlib: this has
two main elements you'll interact with, the **Figure** and the **Axis**.

``` python
figure = plt.Figure()
```

You can think of the **Figure** as the total amount of space we have to
draw. Imagine making a poster for a conference; the **Figure** is the
total amount of paper you have to use. You can split this **Figure** up
into separate **Axes**; you can think of these as each of your different
boxes you put stuff into on your poster. They're where you actually draw
each individual plot. We can access the axes through several methods. If
we just want one axis, we can do the following:

``` python
ax = plt.gca()
```

Now we have a single axis that we can manipulate and draw on. 'gca'
stands for 'get current axis'; it will access the axis on the figure
we're currently focusing on. This is important if we have multiple
figures, but we won't be doing that in this tutorial. We can also get
axes by using 'plt.subplots', which lets us make grids of plots very
easily:


``` python
fig,axs = plt.subplots(nrows=3,ncols=3)
plt.show()
print(axs)
```

![png](/assets/img/2023-12-08-python-plotting/cc3c56bf5012f446885a2c871afa3f1ff72f4707.png)


``` python

    [[<Axes: > <Axes: > <Axes: >]
     [<Axes: > <Axes: > <Axes: >]
     [<Axes: > <Axes: > <Axes: >]]

```

This function gives us a figure, and an array of axes that we can index
and manipulate independently. The last method of setting up subplots
that I'll cover is using 'plt.subplot_mosiac' (thanks for the hot tip
@Pranjal). This lets you much more easily set up complex plots of
different sizes on the same figure. For instance:


``` python
mosaic = '''
        aaaa
        b.cd
        b.cd
        becd
        '''
fig, ax = plt.subplot_mosaic(mosaic)
plt.show()
```

![png](/assets/img/2023-12-08-python-plotting/bc703aa58ca0cea22bfa93af86cc066e4c97f772.png)

We set up a string, 'mosaic', initially --- this defines our layout.
Each individual letter corresponds to a different plot. So what we've
defined is a long row at the top, three tall columns, and one square at
the bottom -- with extra spacing indicated by '.'. We can then access
each axis using our 'ax' variable as a dictionary. The top row
corresponds to ax\['a'\], the left column to ax\['b'\], and so on.
Pretty nice! What kind of cases would it be helpful for you to use this
version vs. the other two?

Now that we have our axes, though... what do we....*do* with them?

### Using our plots

To use our plots, we need some data. Let's use some nice, open dataset
from pandas: the iris dataset and the sea ice dataset. Seaborn has these
specifically for us to practice plotting, yay! Irises (fun fact that I
didn't know initially) are flowers. They are very pretty. And also
different from each other! The iris dataset has three species and a few
different measured attributes. The sea ice dataset has two attributes,
and shows change over time.

``` python
import matplotlib as mpl
iris = sns.load_dataset("iris").dropna()
iris['petal_size'] = iris['petal_length']*iris['petal_width']
seaice = sns.load_dataset('seaice').dropna()
print(f'Iris attributes: {list(iris.columns)}')
print(f'Unique irises: {iris.species.unique()}')
print(f'Number of iris data points: {len(iris)}')
print(f'Sea ice attributes: {list(seaice.columns)}')
print(f'Number of sea ice data points: {len(seaice)}')
seaice['DateFloat'] = mpl.dates.date2num(seaice['Date'])
seaice['DateFloat'] = (seaice['DateFloat'] - seaice['DateFloat'][0])/362.25 + seaice['Date'].dt.year[0]
```

``` python

    Iris attributes: ['sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'petal_length', 'petal_width', 'species', 'petal_size']
    Unique irises: ['setosa' 'versicolor' 'virginica']
    Number of iris data points: 150
    Sea ice attributes: ['Date', 'Extent']
    Number of sea ice data points: 13175

```

### Lineplots

Great! Let's take a look at the sea ice dataset first. This is a dataset
with measurements over time, so it would make sense to plot this as a
line. Let's do that in two separate ways: with matplotlib (left), and
seaborn (right).

``` python
fig,(ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=2)
ax1.plot(seaice['DateFloat'],seaice['Extent'])
sns.lineplot(seaice,x='DateFloat',y='Extent',ax=ax2)
plt.show()
```


![png](/assets/img/2023-12-08-python-plotting/68fb8efff02a57718f8839d11cd7ac8c2f58f4ce.png)

These two plots look almost the exact same! The only difference is that
the Seaborn plot already has labels on it. One thing that you might also
notice is that these plots look like garbage. Take some time: what looks
bad about these? What would you change?


To me, there's all sorts of stuff. They're too small and squished, they
should be longer than they are wide, all the labels are squished
together, the plots are slightly overlapping, the colors are kind of
boring, and there's no title. Let's fix all of these!

<a id='changeplotelts'></a>

``` python
fig,(ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(nrows=2,ncols=1)
ax1.plot(seaice['Date'],seaice['Extent'],linewidth=0.5,linestyle='-')
ax1.set_ylabel('Extent')
ax1.set_xticks([])
ax1.set_title("Matplotlib sea ice extent over time")
sns.lineplot(seaice,x='DateFloat',y='Extent',ax=ax2,linewidth=0.5,linestyle='-')
ax2.set_title('Seaborn sea ice extent over time')
ax2.set_xlabel("Date")
plt.show()
```
![png](/assets/img/2023-12-08-python-plotting/7c25ce9479795b87e2f0bac5a4a12ad75f1a8527.png)


Nice! This generally looks better. The main lesson here is that if we
want to manipulate elements of the plot (axis labels, xticks, etc.), we
can do so using 'ax.set\_...'. Some other things we might be interested
in are:

1.  plotting regression lines on the same plot to see trends over time,
    and
2.  plotting % change between measurements across time.

Let's do all of these! First, I'll show you how to plot two lines *on
different scales* on the same plot for the % change in measurements.
Then we'll go over two methods of plotting regression lines. First, we
can use seaborn's
'[regplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.regplot.html)'
to plot a regression line. Second, we can use seaborn's
'[lmplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.lmplot.html)' to
do the same thing, but with slightly more flexibility!

<a id='addmoreplots'></a>


``` python
fig,(ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(nrows=2,ncols=1)
### 
ax1.plot(seaice['DateFloat'],seaice['Extent'],linewidth=0.5,linestyle='-')
ax12 = ax1.twinx()
ax12.plot(seaice['DateFloat'][1:],np.diff(seaice['Extent'])/seaice['Extent'][:-1] * 100,color='orange',alpha=0.5)
ax1.set_ylabel('Extent')
ax12.set_ylabel("% Change from previous",rotation=270,labelpad=20)
ax1.set_xticks([])
ax1.set_title("Matplotlib sea ice extent over time + % Change")
sns.lineplot(seaice,x='DateFloat',y='Extent',ax=ax2,linewidth=0.5,linestyle='-')
sns.regplot(seaice,x='DateFloat',y='Extent',ax=ax2,scatter=False)
ax2.set_title('Seaborn sea ice extent over time, + regression line')
ax2.set_xlabel("Date")
plt.show()


sns.lmplot(seaice,x='DateFloat',y='Extent',scatter_kws={'s':0.5,'alpha':0.6})
ax = plt.gca()
ax.set_title("Seaborn regression plot in one line of code")
ax.set_xlabel("Date")
plt.show()
```

Great! Now we have plots with multiple things on them, and can make
linear regression plots easily. A good first step for exploring our data
and finding trends! Line plots are a good way to explore time series
data. But what about data that aren't time series? Let's check out some
scatter plots, to explore pairwise relationships in our iris dataset.


<a id='scatterplots'></a>


### Scatter Plots

Let's examine our beautiful flowers. We have four attributes, let's
compare sepal length to sepal width. We can use the *scatter* function
to do that!

``` python
fig,(ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=2)
### 
ax1.scatter(iris['sepal_length'],iris['sepal_width'])#,linewidth=0.5,linestyle='-')
sns.scatterplot(iris,x='sepal_length',y='sepal_width',ax=ax2)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


![png](/assets/img/2023-12-08-python-plotting/f70a5ff6dcf4a9c64d6e6cfa355e7e61a72b81b7.png)


Scatterplots can help us visualize differences in our data. We can do
this super easily if we add in a *hue* to our plot.


<a id='scattercolor'></a>


``` python
fig,ax1 = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=1,figsize=(10,10))
### 
sns.scatterplot(iris,x='sepal_length',y='sepal_width',hue='species',ax=ax1)
plt.tight_layout()
ax1.set_xlabel('Sepal length')
ax1.set_ylabel('Sepal width')
plt.show()
```


![png](/assets/img/2023-12-08-python-plotting/b63312636d23d47e3369d2e84cd2fbee2d29c563.png)


Uh oh! the legend is wayyy too small! let's tone it down a notch. We can
do that super easily!


``` python
fig,ax1 = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=1,figsize=(10,10))
### 
sns.scatterplot(iris,x='sepal_length',y='sepal_width',hue='species',ax=ax1)
plt.tight_layout()

plt.rc('legend',fontsize=10) # using a size in points
ax1.set_xlabel('Sepal length')
ax1.set_ylabel('Sepal width')
plt.show()
```

![png](/assets/img/2023-12-08-python-plotting/b63312636d23d47e3369d2e84cd2fbee2d29c563.png)

<a id='histograms'></a>

### Histograms & KDE plots

Finally, let's get to histograms & KDE plots: we can check out our
distributions of data this way! We can do all of these super easily in
seaborn as well.


``` python
fig,(ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=2,figsize=(10,5))

sns.histplot(iris,x='sepal_length',hue='species',stat='density',ax=ax1)
ax1.set_xlabel('Sepal length')
sns.kdeplot(iris,x='petal_size',hue='species',ax=ax2)
plt.show()
```

There's a whole lot of other good practices in plotting to get into --
choosing the right color, scale, visualization type -- [here's a good
place to start for exploring those
principles](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html).
Seaborn as a whole has a bunch of good plotting tutorials at [this
link](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html) too, so give those a
look if you're interested as well!
