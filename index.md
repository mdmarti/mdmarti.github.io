	  <p>I am a computational cognitive neuroscientist who enjoys thinking about learning (behavioral, neural, machine). I also love teaching and mentorship. Outside of work I love cooking, climbing, playing older video games (currently Spore), and hanging out with my dog. Reach out if you want to chat about any of that!</p>
