	  <p>I am a computational neuroethologist who enjoys thinking about learning (behavioral, neural, machine). I'm passionate about teaching and mentorship, and have taught classes ranging from `Introduction to Python` to `Probabilistic Machine Learning`. Outside of work I love cooking, bouldering, playing older video games (currently Crash Bandicoot), and hanging out with my dog. Please reach out if you'd like to chat, or if you have any good movie recommendations!</p>
